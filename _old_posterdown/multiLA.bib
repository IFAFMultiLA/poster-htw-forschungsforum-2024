Due to the limitations of the current technology, most of the software that has been produced is essentially hypertext with some multimedia additions. The creation of an environment suitable for the production of dynamic, interactive teaching software for Mathematics and Graphics requires the use of an authoring tool as well as an interpretive tool which is capable of parsing text input and producing symbolic, numeric or graphical output. Some specific suggestions for future developments in mathematical and graphical CAL are outlined. This is the basis of an ongoing research project at the University of Ballarat.},

	abstract = {STACK, System for Teaching and Assessment using a Computer algebra Kernel, is a system of a computer aided assessment package for mathematics and works as subsystem of Moodle, one of the Learning Management System (LMS). STACK can provide questions for a Moodle on-line test that inquires an answer as a mathematical expression and assess the answer algebraically. We have been developing Japanese version of STACK as a part of work of internationalization. STACK can not only assess the students’ answer correct or incorrect but also give some suitable feedbacks for the various students’ answer. Partial score can be given for incomplete answers. In order to use the rich function of STACK, we have to design a question carefully. However, one of the difficulties of STACK is authoring questions because the interface is inconvenient and we have to be on-line when we author questions. In order to overcome the problem, we have developed a question-authoring tool by the use of Excel and VBA. A question can be written on Excel interface and XML file is produced that can be imported to STACK question bank. Furthermore the tool can visualize a structure of STACK question, a potential response tree, on a browser. Compared to authoring questions on the existing web interface of STACK, it is expected that time spent on authoring questions can be reduced.},

Having an authoring tool that facilitates interdisciplinary intervention in the design and implementation of such applications is a current challenge to bring TI to different contexts. This article presents an authoring tool (named EDIT) and analyzes its acceptance by educators for creating educational activities. The novelty of the tool lies in the possibility of creating projects with a schedule of educational activities, sequenced as required for a group of students. In addition, it has speciﬁc characteristics for the educational scenario, such as the personalization of feedback and the meta-annotation of projects. Sessions were held with educators (n ¼ 38) to analyze variables related to the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use) when creating TI educational activities on tabletops using the EDIT tool. The sessions were observed and recorded on video, and a Focus Group was held afterward. During the sessions, educators gave a positive assessment in relation to using this type of tool. It was observed that, in general, they ﬁnd TI valuable mostly for working with children. Finally, the results showed a high acceptance obtained from the TAM and the novel features of EDIT were found to be useful.},

                Authoring tools play a crucial role in the development of learning content facilitating the creation of Learning Objects. However, not much work has been done in order to determine if educators actually can use these tools to create effective and reusable Learning Objects in an easy way. This paper address this issue by presenting and evaluating an open source authoring tool called ViSH Editor. Three factors were evaluated: the usability and user acceptance of the authoring tool, the quality and learning effectiveness of the created Learning Objects, and the reusability of these resources. Usability was evaluated through a lab test and the user acceptance with a survey among 180 users. Quality evaluation was conducted using LORI (Learning Object Review Instrument). The learning effectiveness was evaluated through learner surveys and test scores. Finally, reusability was evaluated by using the LORI instrument, by measuring metadata quality using a set of metrics, and by a quantitative analysis of reuse. Results show that ViSH Editor is an authoring tool capable of allowing educators to create effective and reusable Learning Objects in an easy way. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Load balancing is considered a major challenge affecting in cloud performance Methods: An existing problem is how to allocate Virtual Machines (VMs) to Physical Machines (PMs) or hosts. This process is called VM placement. An algorithm is proposed that can reduce power consumption. Findings: The proposed algorithm assigns VMs onto PMs based on first fit decreasing algorithm and improves an existed one through reducing power consumption by turning-off some under load hosts if available and migrating their VMs to other active hosts. Application: The presented approach could decrease significantly energy consumption in comparison with the existing one through migrating VMs from underload hosts and turns them off.},

	abstract = {Student monitoring, the most common practice in Learning Analytics (LA), has become easier and more eﬃcient thanks to the use of tracking approach that consists of collecting data of users and of their interactions throughout learning platforms. While LA gives considerable assistance to the tutors in the tasks of monitoring online learning, it also creates major drawbacks for the learners. For instance, tracking approach in LA raises many privacy questions. As for the learners, knowing that their personal data are being used, even for educational purposes, they could radically change their perception on e-learning technologies. Not to mention that these concerns would have a strong impact, sometimes very negatively, on not only their behaviors but also their learning outcomes. To better understand the side eﬀect of LA, more particularly the privacy issues in e-learning, the research eﬀort presented in this paper covers two main aspects. First, it outlines various tracking approaches in e-learning. Second, it analyzes how the learners perceive the use of their personal data and the related privacy issues. To do so, an experiment has been carried out with the participation of students from three diﬀerent universities in France and one university in Germany. The major contribution of this paper is the awareness-raising of privacy concerns in exploiting tracking data in e-learning, which are often overlooked by researchers and learning content providers.},

However, in traditional instruction, it is difficult to develop learners’ mathematics reading and spatial abilities. Therefore, many students struggle to understand real-world problems and lack the spatial ability to form internal imagery. To cope with this problem, in this study, an interactive e-book was developed. To assess the effect, a quasi-experimental pretest–posttest with a control group design method was adopted. The study was designed around the lesson topic “Three Views.” The participants were 34 seventh-grade students. The participants were divided into two groups: while students in the experimental group studied the lesson using the interactive e-book, those in the control group used a conventional e-book. The result indicated that both groups had a significant increase in the mathematics reading ability test, and even though there was no significant difference between the two groups in the subscales (general reading comprehension, prior knowledge of mathematics and mathematics specific skills), a significant difference was observed in the overall mathematics reading score in favor of the experimental group. In addition to the mathematics reading result, the interactive e-book learning mode had significant impacts on students’ spatial ability. It was also found that richness of content with visual and interactive elements provided in the interactive e-book enhanced students’ satisfaction with the teaching material.},

	abstract = {An important course in the computer science discipline is ‘Data Structures and Algorithms’ (DSA). The coursework lays emphasis on experiential learning for building students’ programming and algorithmic reasoning abilities. Teachers set up a repertoire of formative programming exercises to engage students with different programmatic scenarios to build their know-what, know-how and know-why competencies. Automated assessment tools can assist teachers in inspecting, marking, and grading of programming exercises and also support them in providing students with formative feedback in real-time. This article describes the design of a bespoke automarker that was integrated into the DSA coursework and therefore served as an instructional tool. Activity theory has provided the pedagogical lens to examine how the automarker-mediated instructional strategy enabled self-reflection and assisted students in their formative learning journey. Learner experiences gathered from 39 students enrolled in DSA course shows that the automarker facilitated practicebased learning to advance students know-what, know-why and know-how skills. This study contributes to both curricula and pedagogic practice by showcasing the integration of an automated assessment strategy with programming-related coursework to inform future teaching and assessment practice.},

When physical learning is not feasible, and when the demand cannot be met through actual hands-on laboratory sessions, as has been during the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual laboratory courses can be considered as an alternative education medium. This study focuses on developing a generic modular virtual laboratory framework that allows engineers, game designers, and developers to build lab experiments as serious games—games with ulterior motives rather than only entertainment—without writing additional code. A virtual lab serious game for civil engineering’s soil mechanics course was created in Unity3D as a WebGL game, and it was tested within the framework by 24 students (12 from the Civil Engineering Department, the rest from computer science-related degrees). Seven faculty members evaluated if the serious game met the learning outcomes. In addition, nine engineers and designers assessed the framework’s capabilities and analyzed its ﬂexibility and reuse aspects. To analyze the usability and acceptability of the created game, standard questionnaires such as the technology acceptance model, system usability scale, and presence were employed. The study was done in two phases: participants tested the ﬁrst version of the game, and the second version was built based on their feedback on the ﬁrst version. The ﬁndings indicate that the modular structure has signiﬁcant potential for use in a variety of ﬁelds and laboratory courses. The proposed game has received very positive feedback and can be considered a use case for the potential of games in interactive virtual laboratories.},

	abstract = {Educational dashboards enable students to monitor and reﬂect on academic performance and administrative aspects of the learning processes. Occasionally, educational institutions integrate dashboards using the information found in their learning management systems or their students’ information desks. Learning analytics offers ways to enrich these dashboards and expose students to analyzed information beyond the monitored data provided such as smart recommendations. Despite the large variety of dashboards, the students’ centric perspective and the ability to adapt the dashboard to their personal needs is not a common practice. To identify and support the needs of students who wish to track aspects of their learning routine, it is very important to position the students at the core of the design process of these dashboards. This article presents a new phase in our research to expand our understanding of the students’ needs in monitoring their educational routines and preferences while using an advanced form of a learning analytics dashboard. We propose an optimized approach for designing educational dashboards. In this sense, we examine and seek to integrate the components that are prominently required by students. Hence, we address both the type of components as well as their arrangement within the customized dashboard. The outcomes of our efforts reveal ﬁndings concerning students’ trends and habits when exploiting these dashboards. It also offers pivotal insights and recommendations for the optimized implementation of learning analytics dashboards that are aligned with the students’ authentic requirements.},

Our ﬁndings reveal positive effects of tracking time on time management skills. Variations in the channel, content and timing of the mobile notiﬁcations to foster reﬂective practice are investigated, and time-logging patterns are described. These results not only provide evidence of the beneﬁts of recording learning time, but also suggest relevant cues on how mobile notiﬁcations should be designed and prompted towards self-regulated learning of students in online courses.},

Considering the complex multimodality of pair programming caused by students’ discourses, behaviors, and socio-emotions, it is of critical importance to examine their collaborative patterns from a holistic, multimodal, dynamic perspective. But there is a lack of research investigating the collaborative patterns generated by the multimodality. This research applied multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) to collect 19 undergraduate student pairs’ multimodal process and products data to examine different collaborative patterns based on the quantitative, structural, and transitional characteristics. The results revealed four collaborative patterns (i.e., a consensus-achieved pattern, an argumentation-driven pattern, an individual-oriented pattern, and a trial-and-error pattern), associated with different levels of process and summative performances. Theoretical, pedagogical, and analytical implications were provided to guide the future research and practice.},

Effective attribution of their learning success or failure in the context of a small private online course (SPOC) could generate students’ motivation toward learning success while an incorrect attribution would lead to a sense of helplessness. Based on the attribution theories developed by Wiener and Kelly with learning analytics technology, this article developed a systematic framework for learning analytics in SPOC in an undergraduate course. A total of 197 undergraduates participated in the experiment and were randomly assigned to a treatment group (98 students) and a control group (99 students). The treatment group applied the learning analytics system framework in a SPOC, and the control group applied the traditional SPOC teaching method, and other conditions are consistent. Structural equation modeling is adopted to explore the correlations among attribution variables (i.e., ability, effort, difﬁculty of the task, and luck), motivational variables (i.e., endogenous motivation, and extrinsic motivation), and learning achievement. The results indicated that all four attribution variables have a signiﬁcant correlation with both endogenous and extrinsic motivation and have a signiﬁcant effect on learning achievement. Students in the experimental class exhibited better outcomes than students in the control class with respect to learning motivation and learning achievement. The ﬁndings validated the effectiveness of using the SPOC analytics system to facilitate SPOC learners making effective attributions, leading to the enhancement of learning motivation and achievement.},

While much attention has been paid to developing teacher-facing dashboards, less is known about how they are designed, implemented and evaluated. This paper presents a systematic literature review of existing studies reporting on teacher-facing LA dashboards. Out of the 1968 articles retrieved from several databases, 50 articles were included in the final analysis. Guided by several frameworks, articles were coded based on the following dimensions: purpose, theoretical grounding, stakeholder involvement, ethics and privacy, design, implementation, and evaluation criteria. The findings show that most dashboards are designed to increase teachers’ awareness but with limited actionable insights to allow intervention. Moreover, while teachers are involved in the design process, this is mainly at the exploratory/problem definition stage, with little input beyond this stage. Most dashboards were prescriptive, less customisable, and implicit about the theoretical constructs behind their designs. In addition, dashboards are deployed at prototype and pilot stages, and the evaluation is dominated by selfreports and users’ reactions with limited focus on changes to teaching and learning. Besides, only one study considered privacy as a design requirement. Based on the findings of the study and synthesis of existing literature, we propose a four-dimensional checklist for planning, designing, implementing and evaluating LA dashboards.},

However, although the learning outcomes are believed to improve learning and teaching, prognosticating the attainment of student outcomes remains underexplored. A decade of research work conducted between 2010 and November 2020 was surveyed to present a fundamental understanding of the intelligent techniques used for the prediction of student performance, where academic success is strictly measured using student learning outcomes. The electronic bibliographic databases searched include ACM, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Scopus, Springer, and Web of Science. Eventually, we synthesized and analyzed a total of 62 relevant papers with a focus on three perspectives, (1) the forms in which the learning outcomes are predicted, (2) the predictive analytics models developed to forecast student learning, and (3) the dominant factors impacting student outcomes. The best practices for conducting systematic literature reviews, e.g., PICO and PRISMA, were applied to synthesize and report the main results. The attainment of learning outcomes was measured mainly as performance class standings (i.e., ranks) and achievement scores (i.e., grades). Regression and supervised machine learning models were frequently employed to classify student performance. Finally, student online learning activities, term assessment grades, and student academic emotions were the most evident predictors of learning outcomes. We conclude the survey by highlighting some major research challenges and suggesting a summary of signiﬁcant recommendations to motivate future works in this ﬁeld.},

EDM researchers have primarily focused on course-specific data analyses of students’ performances, and rare attempts are made at the domain level that may benefit the educational institutes at large to gauge and improve their institutional effectiveness. Our work aims to fill this gap by examining students’ transcripts data for identifying similar groups of students and patterns that might associate with these different cohorts of students based on: (a) difficulty level of a course category, (b) formation of course trajectories, and, (c) transitioning of students between different performance groups. We have exploited descriptive data mining and visualization methods to analyze transcript data of 1398 undergraduate Computer Science students of a private university in Pakistan. The dataset includes students’ transcript data of 124 courses from nine distinct course categories. In the end, we have discussed our findings in detail, challenges, and, future work directions.},

The relevant EDM and LA techniques were identified and compared across these dimensions. Based on the results of 402 studies, it was found that specific EDM and LA techniques could offer the best means of solving certain learning problems.

	abstract = {Today, Web Analytics (WA) is commonly used to obtain key information about users and their behavior on websites. Besides, with the rise of online learning, Learning Analytics (LA) emerged as a separate research ﬁeld for collecting and analyzing learners’ interactions on online learning platforms. Although the foundation of both methods is similar, WA has not been profoundly used for LA purposes. However, especially large-scale online learning environments may beneﬁt from WA as it is more sophisticated and well-established in comparison to LA. Therefore, this paper aims to examine to what extent WA can be utilized in this context, without compromising the learners’ data privacy. For this purpose, Google Analytics was integrated into the Massive Open Online Course platform of the Hasso Plattner Institute as a proof of concept. It was tested with two deployments of the platform: openHPI and openSAP, where thousands of learners gain academic and industry knowledge about engineering education. Besides capturing behavioral data, the platforms’ existing LA dashboards were extended by WA metrics. The evaluation of the integration showed that WA covers a large part of the relevant metrics and is particularly suitable for obtaining an overview of the platform’s global activity, but reaches its limitations when it comes to learner-speciﬁc metrics.},

These aspects are often considered individually in computing education research, demonstrating limited understanding of how and when students learn best. This issue confines researchers to contextualize evidencedriven outcomes when learning behaviour deviates from pedagogical intentions. Multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) captures data essential for measuring constructs (e.g., cognitive load, confusion) that are posited in the learning sciences as important for learning, and cannot effectively be measured solely with the use of programming process data (IDE-log data). Thus, we augmented IDE-log data with physiological data (e.g., gaze data) and participants’ facial expressions, collected during a debugging learning activity. The findings emphasize the need for learning analytics that are consequential for learning, rather than easy and convenient to collect. In that regard, our paper aims to provoke productive reflections and conversations about the potential of MMLA to expand and advance the synergy of learning analytics and learning design among the community of educators from a post-evaluation design-aware process to a permanent monitoring process of adaptation.},

Part of the eﬀorts have focused on understanding how users interact and engage with web content. However, the measurement of within-content engagement remains a diﬃcult and unsolved task. This is because of the lack of standardised, wellvalidated methods for measuring engagement, especially in an online context. To address this gap, we perform a controlled user study where we observe how users respond to online news in the presence or lack of interest. We collect mouse tracking data, which are known to correlate with visual attention, and examine how cursor behaviour can inform user engagement measures. The proposed method does not use any pre-determined concepts to characterise the cursor patterns. We, rather, follow an unsupervised approach and use a large set of features engineered from our data to extract the cursor patterns. Our ﬁndings support the connection between gaze and cursor behaviour but also, and more importantly, reveal other dependencies, such as the correlation between cursor activity and experienced aﬀect. Finally, we demonstrate the value of our method by predicting the outcome of online news reading experiences.},

	abstract = {Recently, learning analytics (LA) has drawn the attention of academics, researchers, and administrators. This interest is motivated by the need to better understand teaching, learning, “intelligent content,” and personalization and adaptation. While still in the early stages of research and implementation, several organizations (Society for Learning Analytics Research and the International Educational Data Mining Society) have formed to foster a research community around the role of data analytics in education. This article considers the research fields that have contributed technologies and methodologies to the development of learning analytics, analytics models, the importance of increasing analytics capabilities in organizations, and models for deploying analytics in educational settings. The challenges facing LA as a field are also reviewed, particularly regarding the need to increase the scope of data capture so that the complexity of the learning process can be more accurately reflected in analysis. Privacy and data ownership will become increasingly important for all participants in analytics projects. The current legal system is immature in relation to privacy and ethics concerns in analytics. The article concludes by arguing that LA has sufficiently developed, through conferences, journals, summer institutes, and research labs, to be considered an emerging research field.},

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency.},

	abstract = {This article reports on a study exploring student perspectives on the collection and use of student data for learning analytics. With data collected via a mixed methods approach from 2,051 students across six Australian universities, it provides critical insights from students as a key stakeholder group. Findings indicate that while students are generally comfortable with the use of data to support their learning, they do have concerns particularly in relation to the use of demographic data, location data and data collected from wireless networks, social media and mobile applications. Two key themes emerged related to the need for transparency to support informed consent and personal-professional boundary being critical. This supports findings from other research, which reflects the need for a nuanced approach when providing information to students about the data we collect, including what we are collecting, why and how this is being used. 
Implications for practice or policy: 
 
When implementing the use of dashboards, institutions should ideally include opportunities for students to opt in and out, rather than being set so that students have agency over their data and learning. 
When undertaking work in relation to learning analytics, staff need to ensure the focus of their work relates to student learning rather than academic research. 
When institutions and academic staff collect and use student data (regardless of the purpose for doing so), all aspects of these processes need to be transparent to students.},

Most of the data is collected from Learning Management Systems deployed at established educational institutions. In addition, other learning platforms, most notably Massive Open Online Courses such as Udacity and Coursera or other educational initiatives such as Khan Academy, generate large amounts of data. However, there is no generally agreedupon data model for student interactions. Thus, analysis tools must be tailored to each system’s particular data structure, reducing their interoperability and increasing development costs. Some e-Learning standards designed for content interoperability include data models for gathering student performance information. In this paper, we describe how well-known LA tools collect data, which we link to how two e-Learning standards – IEEE Standard for Learning Technology and Experience API – define their data models. From this analysis, we identify the advantages of using these e-Learning standards from the point of view of Learning Analytics.},

In the last few years we have gathered data from two projects: Orient@mente, an online platform where students can prepare for university entry tests and browse online courses before enrolling in one, and start@unito, which offers open online university courses in various disciplines. In addition, we have also studied and analyzed the results of the teacher training experience carried out for the start@unito project, as well as those obtained from a survey involving secondary school teachers and the possible employment of the start@unito OERs in their everyday teaching. Our sources of data are students’ activity online, the results of formative automatic assessment, and the questionnaires given to the learners; the types of questions range from Likert scale evaluations to multiple choice, yes/no and a few open questions. In this way, the insights gained from both usage tracking and questionnaires can be used to make interventions to improve the teaching and the learning experience. In this paper we discuss the different ways we employ LA in our projects and try to evaluate their effectiveness in terms of outcomes, structure, availability, statistics and interventions.},

This, in turn, means that there are no absolute measures of usability, since, if the usability of an artefact is defined by the context in which that artefact is used, measures of usability must of necessity be defined by that context too. Despite this, there is a need for broad general measures which can be used to compare usability across a range of contexts. In addition, there is a need for “quick and dirty” methods to allow low cost assessments of usability in industrial systems evaluation.

The community has used journals, conferences, workshops, and informal online outlets as venues for knowledge exchange, co-creation, and inspiration. As the field matures, institutions of higher education increasingly offer educational programs to train the next generation of leaders in learning analytics research, practice, and policy. These efforts to disseminate the theories, methods, applications, and values of the learning analytics community in formal and informal educational environments are the focus of this chapter. We systematically survey the international landscape of current learning analytics programs (degree programs, certificates, courses, workshops, and online resources) to identify the scope and characteristics of available programs. We then present an in-depth case study of a learning analytics course offered to undergraduate and graduate students at Cornell University. The case study demonstrates a pedagogical approach to learning analytics education for students with a more technical emphasis. Finally, we discuss the current state of learning analytics education and identify challenges and opportunities for learning analytics education going forward.},

In an online lecture, instructors may communicate non-verbally (e.g., via highlighting) some important concepts in the script to draw attention to particular key elements for a given topic. The so-called signalling or cueing strategies, where visual (text-based or picture-based) cues draw attention to relevant parts of the material, come into play. In the present paper, we address the following research question: Do different usage patterns of nonverbal signalling cues, such as highlighting words and formulas, as well as making notes in lecture materials, have an impact on learning success in an online format? In our retrospective analysis of lecture notes and the contained nonverbal signalling cues against the probability of passing exam questions in quantitative online courses, we were able to confirm a significant positive effect of highlighting and colour coding of formulas and a significant negative impact of using many signalling tools simultaneously. The results are promising for recommending signalling strategies for course instruction in quantitative disciplines.},

Three major categories of findings were identified: issues related to online learners, instructors, and content development. Learners’ issues included learners’ expectations, readiness, identity, and participation in online courses. Instructors’ issues included changing faculty roles, transitioning from face-to-face to online, time management, and teaching styles. Content issues included the role of instructors in content development, integration of multimedia in content, role of instructional strategies in content development, and considerations for content development. To address these challenges in online education, higher education institutions need to provide professional development for instructors, trainings for learners, and technical support for content development.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In a study conducted over 3 large symposia on intensive review of internal medicine, we previously assessed the features that were most important to course participants in evaluating the quality of a lecture. In this study, we attempt to validate these observations by assessing prospectively the extent to which ratings of specific lecture features would predict the overall evaluation of lectures.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After each lecture, 143 to 355 course participants rated the overall lecture quality of 69 speakers involved in a large symposium on intensive review of internal medicine. In addition, 7 selected participants and the course directors rated specific lecture features and overall quality for each speaker. The relations among the variables were assessed through Pearson correlation coefficients and cluster analysis. Regression analysis was performed to determine which features would predict the overall lecture quality ratings. The features that most highly correlated with ratings of overall lecture quality were the speaker's abilities to identify key points (r =.797) and be engaging (r =.782), the lecture clarity (r =.754), and the slide comprehensibility (r =.691) and format (r =.660). The three lecture features of engaging the audience, lecture clarity, and using a case-based format were identified through regression as the strongest predictors of overall lecture quality ratings (R2 = 0.67, P = 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified core lecture features that positively affect the success of the lecture. We believe our findings are useful for lecturers wanting to improve their effectiveness and for educators who design continuing medical education curricula.},

	abstract = {Online learning engagement detection is a fundamental problem in educational information technology. Efficient detection of students’ learning situations can provide information to teachers to help them identify students having trouble in real time. To improve the accuracy of learning engagement detection, we have collected two aspects of students’ behavior data: face data (using adaptive weighted Local Gray Code Patterns for facial expression recognition) and mouse interaction. In this article, we propose a novel learning engagement detection algorithm based on the collected data (students’ behavior), which come from the cameras and the mouse in the online learning environment. The cameras were utilized to capture students’ face images, while the mouse movement data were captured simultaneously. In the process of image data labeling, we built two datasets for classifier training and testing. One took the mouse movement data as a reference, while the other did not. We performed experiments on two datasets using several methods and found that the classifier trained by the former dataset had a better performance, and its recognition rate is higher than that of the latter one (94.60\% vs. 91.51\%).},

	abstract = {Confusion is an emotion that is likely to occur while learning complex information. This emotion can be beneficial to learners in that it can foster engagement, leading to deeper understanding. However, if learners fail to resolve confusion, its effect can be detrimental to learning. Such detrimental learning experiences are particularly concerning within digital learning environments (DLEs), where a teacher is not physically present to monitor learner engagement and adapt the learning experience accordingly. However, with better information about a learner’s emotion and behavior, it is possible to improve the design of interactive DLEs (IDLEs) not only in promoting productive confusion but also in preventing overwhelming confusion. This article reviews different methodological approaches for detecting confusion, such as self-report and behavioral and physiological measures, and discusses their implications within the theoretical framework of a zone of optimal confusion. The specificities of several methodologies and their potential application in IDLEs are discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper explores Pointer Assisted Reading (PAR), a reading behavior consisting of moving the mouse cursor (also known as the pointer) along sentences to mark the reading position, similarly to finger-pointing when reading a book. The study shows that PAR is an uncommon reading technique and examines methods to extract and visualize the PAR activity of web users. An analysis shows that PAR data of real users reveal reading properties, such as speed, and reading patterns, such as skipping and rereading. Eye-tracking is usually used to analyze user reading behaviors. This paper advocates for considering PAR-tracking as a feasible alternative to eye-tracking on websites, as tracking the eye gaze of ordinary web users is usually impractical. PAR data might help in spotting quality issues in the textual content of a website, such as unclear text or content that might not interest the website users, based on analyzing reading properties and patterns (e.g. reading speed, skipping, and rereading). Accordingly, PAR-tracking may have various practical applications in a wide range of fields, and particularly in educational technology, e-learning, and web analytics.},

	abstract = {Eye tracking is one of the most exploited techniques in literature for finding usability problems in web-based user interfaces (UIs). However, it is usually employed in a laboratory setting, considering that an eye-tracker is not commonly used in web browsing. In contrast, web application providers usually exploit remote techniques for large-scale user studies (e.g. A/B testing), tracking low-level interactions such as mouse clicks and movements. In this article, we discuss a method for predicting whether the user is looking at the content pointed by the cursor, exploiting the mouse movement data and a segmentation of the contents in a web page. We propose an automatic method for segmenting content groups inside a web page that, applying both image and code analysis techniques, identifies the user-perceived group of contents with a mean pixel-based error around the 20\%. In addition, we show through a user study that such segmentation information enhances the precision and the accuracy in predicting the correlation between between the user’s gaze and the mouse position at the content level, without relaying on user-specific features.},

Research papers from distinguished resources: Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, PubMed are reviewed and analyzed. The study examined the effectiveness of learning style and different classification methods in various e-learning problems. Different research papers have been classified based on learning style theories, adaptive classification methods, specific features and challenges faced in individual e-learning problems. 129 articles were studied and reviewed for meta-analysis. When adaptive and dynamic learning, blended with different learning styles and problems, then it’s found effective, which enhances learner’s performance and knowledge compared to traditional or conventional learning. This study supports researchers, academicians and practitioners in effectively adopting learning styles and method correspond to learning problems and provides a deep insight into its state of art.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 outbreak has compelled many universities to immediately switch to the online delivery of lessons. Many instructors, however, have found developing effective online lessons in a very short period of time very stressful and difficult. This study describes how we successfully addressed this crisis by transforming two conventional flipped classes into fully online flipped classes with the help of a cloudbased video conferencing app. As in a conventional flipped course, in a fully online flipped course students are encouraged to complete online pre-class work. But unlike in the conventional flipped approach, students do not subsequently meet face-to-face in physical classrooms, but rather online. This study examines the effect of fully online flipped classrooms on student learning performance in two stages. In Stage One, we explain how we drew on the 5E framework to design two conventional flipped classes. The 5E framework consists of five phases—Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate. In Stage Two, we describe how we transformed the two conventional flipped classes into fully online flipped classes. Quantitative analyses of students’ final course marks reveal that the participants in the fully online flipped classes performed as effectively as participants in the conventional flipped learning classes. Our qualitative analyses of student and staff reflection data identify seven good practices for videoconferencing-assisted online flipped classrooms.},
